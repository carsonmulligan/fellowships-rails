> when i was looking for scholarhsips it was an intensely addicting progress -- i would get up early early in the morning and search for niche scholarships and apply. i did win one of these scholarships from a company called PCB Solutions. it was a small scholarhship but scholarships are about momentum. getting good grades your first semester is very important. then its important to get inspired by the idea htat you can actually be a person who wins scholarships enough to pay for all of their school. the best place to start usually is be grepping the current univesrity you are at to find the scholarship opportunities. i used to do this by searching my department, and university wide for opportunities. i wouuld go to the undergraduate research and fellowships office website and see what they had there. i found lots that were interesting and thought about them. i kept a journal but would have benefitted from a system that would have allowed me to save the scholarships i was looking at, and buid a timeline.
